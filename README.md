# Linear-Regression-Rent-vs-Sizew
Predictive analysis of rent data based on the type of area (super area) to determine the rent based on the size of the home.
The model showed a poor correlation of determination at only 0.29 as well as a high mean squared error. Showing that the model is not a very good predictor of rent prices.
